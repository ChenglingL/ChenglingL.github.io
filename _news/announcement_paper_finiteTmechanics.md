This work explores the unusual structural dynamics of biological tissue models. Using the 2D Voronoi model, we uncover a surprising link between its elastic properties and glassy dynamics.

A key finding is that, unlike conventional glassformers, the shear and bulk moduli increase with temperature, revealing an unexpected mechanical response. More importantly, we show that the structural relaxation time is directly controlled by the plateau shear modulus, suggesting that elasticity dictates how cells rearrange over time.

These insights lead us to propose that under-constrained systems may form a new class of "ultra-strong" glassformers, opening new directions in the study of biological tissues and complex materials.

Please see the paper [Connecting anomalous elasticity and sub-Arrhenius structural dynamics in a cell-based model for details](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.048203) for details.
